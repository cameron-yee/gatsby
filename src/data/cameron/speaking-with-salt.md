Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving. At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison—that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak. Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the time. Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.

\--Colossians 4:2-6

# Focus

This week, the verse about salt really stuck in my mind.  How can speech be seasoned with salt?  Why does it matter? How can we season our speech?

\
Before talking about our speech being seasoned, we need to talk about the content of our speech. Matthew 12:34 says: “...for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks." Saltiness of speech does little good until one has some element of control over their tongue. This is an ongoing process that no one person will ever be perfect at. A person needs to be aware and working on this before saltiness can be a major focus. 

Salt, in the first century, was used for flavor, disinfectant, preservation, and hospitality.



\## Flavor

Our speech should add flavor to our conversations. Filler words such as take away power from speech.  For me, my main filler words include: gotcha, like, um, interesting, cool, sweet, and yeah (when texting).  These words rarely add value to a conversation.  At best, they affirm to the speaker that I am listening.  Simple eye-contact or a small sound would probably suffice for that use.  In fact, they would probably be a lot better because they would differentiate my words from just sounds or body language.  This would allow me to build more weight into the words when I actually use them in a meaningful way. Flavor can be added by withdrawing words or using them more selectively.  Too much salt is a bad thing.  The best use of it is to add to an already existing flavor.

Flavor can also be added by smart word choice.  Vocabulary decisions add nuance and thought to conversations. A speaker may describe their feelings for something with the two similar words: "like" or "love". These two words may be interchanged with each other to describe a similar meaning, but using one word instead of the other allows for more specific meaning. Think about telling someone "I like you" versus "I love you".  Two different things will be communicated. Poor word choice can also diminish a speaker’s ethos and distance an audience. One foolish phrase or word can ruin an opportunity or kill a relationship. 

\## Disinfectant

Our speech should promote healing. We can do this through encouragement, speaking truth to point people to the Healer, or affirming a person’s value to God.  Compassion, empathy, and advice can all be given through words.

\## Preservation

A smartly chosen word can stick in someone's mind and allow them to remember a thought or idea.

\## Hospitality

Words can be used to invite people in, or to exclude them.  A good conversation can make someone feel welcome and more open.  This will allow for relationships to be built more rapidly and go deeper quicker.  It is also vital for the growth of churches.  Many people do not continue attending a church after visiting because the people at the church were disengaging or awkward.
