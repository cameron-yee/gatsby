  Before talking about our speech being seasoned with salt, we need to talk about the content of our speech. “Out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks (Proverbs). Saltiness of speech does no good until one has some element of control over one’s tongue. This is an ongoing process that no one person will ever be perfect at. A person needs to be aware and working on this before saltiness even matters. 

Salt, in the first century, was used for flavor, disinfectant, preservation, and hospitality.

Our speech should add flavor to our conversations. Filler words such as um take away power from speech. Vocabulary choice adds nuance and weight to conversations. A speaker may describe their feelings for something with the words like or love. These two words may be interchanged with each other to describe a similar meaning, but using one word instead of the other allows for more specific meaning. Poor word choice can also diminish a speaker’s ethos and distance an audience. One foolish phrase or word can ruin an opportunity or kill a relationship. 

Our speech should promote healing. We can do this through encouragement, speaking truth to point people to the Healer, or affirming a person’s value to God.
