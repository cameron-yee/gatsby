## Intro

### The Problem:

The problem of pain is broken into 3 parts by C.S. Lewis:

<ol type="A">
  <li>God is all-good (omnibenevolent)</li>
  <li>God is all-powerful (omnipotent)</li>
  <li>People are not perfectly happy.  There's a lot wrong in the world.</li>
</ol>

Therefore,

<ol type="A" start=4>
  <li>God must be either lacking goodness or lacking power.</li>
</ol>

Essentially, the argument is:

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>A + B + C = D</strong></p>

## Focus

"The first condition, then, of what is called a selfish love among men is lacking with God. He has no natural necessities, no passion, to compete with His wish for the beloved’s welfare: or if there is in Him something which we have to imagine after the analogy of a passion, a want, it is there by His own will and for our sakes. And the second condition is lacking too. The real interests of a child may differ from that which his father’s affection instinctively demands, because the child is a separate being from the father with a nature which has its own needs and does not exist solely for the father nor find its whole perfection in being loved by him, and which the father does not fully understand. *But creatures are not thus separate from their Creator, nor can He misunderstand them.* The place for which He designs them in His scheme of things is the place they are made for. When they reach it their nature is fulfilled and their happiness attained: a broken bone in the universe has been set, the anguish is over. When we want to be something other than the thing God wants us to be, we must be wanting what, in fact, will not make us happy. *Those Divine demands which sound to our natural ears most like those of a despot and least like those of a lover, in fact marshall us where we should want to go if we knew what we wanted.* He demands our worship, our obedience, our prostration. Do we suppose that they can do Him any good, or fear, like the chorus in Milton, that human irreverence can bring about “His glory’s diminution”? A man can no more diminish God’s glory by refusing to worship Him than a lunatic can put out the sun by scribbling the word “darkness” on the walls of his cell. But God wills our good, and our good is to love Him (with that responsive love proper to creatures) and to love Him we must know Him: and if we know Him, we shall in fact fall on our faces. If we do not, that only shows that what we are trying to love is not yet God — though it may be the nearest approximation to God which our thought and fantasy can attain. Yet the call is not only to prostration and awe; it is to a reflection of the Divine life, a creaturely participation in the Divine attributes which is far beyond our present desires. We are bidden to “put on Christ”, to become like God. **That is, whether we like it or not, God intends to give us what we need**, not what we now think we want. Once more, we are embarrassed by the intolerable compliment, by too much love, not too little."

\-C.S. Lewis in The Problem of Pain (emphasis added)

### Notes

1. "The first condition": God loves for _our_ benefit.  We know this because we can do nothing for _His_ benefit.
2. If our understanding and experience of God does not lead us to face-down worship, we are not actually experiencing God.  And if our worship does not feel somewhat external, it must not actually be worship.  What I mean by this is that worship cannot be forced.  It has to come from external experience.  The external is God, the experience varies.  It might be argued that the experience is internal because God lives inside of us.  This is true, but it is not our natural human nature causing the worship then.  It is the supernatural.
3. We cannot experience "life to the full" (John 10ish) unless we are living within God's design for our lives.  This entails at least a few things:

* We're in an active relationship with Him.  This means that His Spirit is within us. This means we are praying.  This means that we are experiencing life change because of the work of sanctification within us.
* We're involved in some sort of work (Cultural Mandate in Genesis)
* We're consistently resting (Sabbath)
* We're involved in the Church (capital C).  _Usually_, this means we are involved in a church (lowercase c).

4. Asking God to _NOT_ make us more like Him is asking Him to love us less.  Asking God to stop sanctifying us, or allowing us to act without discipline for our actions, is asking God to love us less. Sanctification often involves pain.  The sculpture is not afraid to break the clay and reform it.  Thus, God continually breaks and reshapes us.
